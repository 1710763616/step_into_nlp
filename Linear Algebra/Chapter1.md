# Introduction to Vectors

## Vectors and Linear Combinations

- linear algebra is built on adding vectors and multiplying by scalars
- the combinations $cu$ fill a line through (0, 0, 0)
- the combinations $cu+dv$ fill a plane through (0, 0, 0)
- the combinations $cu+dv+ew$ fill three-dimensional space
