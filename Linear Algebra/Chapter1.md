# Introduction to Vectors

## Vectors and Linear Combinations

- linear algebra is built on adding vectors and multiplying by scalars
- the combinations $cu$ fill a line through (0, 0, 0)
- the combinations $cu+dv$ fill a plane through (0, 0, 0)
- the combinations $cu+dv+ew$ fill three-dimensional space $w$ is not in the plane of $u$ and $v$

## Lengths and Dot Products

- the standart unit vectors along the $x$ and $y$ axes are written $i$ and $j$
- unit vectors $u$ and $U$ at angle $\theta$ have $u\cdot U = \cos\theta$. Certainly $\abs{u\cdot U} \le 1$
- SHAWARZ INEQUALITY $\abs{v\cdot w} \le \abs{\abs{v}}\abs{\abs{w}}$
- TRIANGLE INEQUALITY $\abs{\abs{v+w}} \le \abs{\abs{v}} + \abs{\abs{w}}$
- Geometric mean $\le$ Arithmetic mean   $ab\le \frac{a^2+b^2}{2}$

## Matrices

- Independence $w$ is  not in the palne of $u$ and $v$
- Dependence $w$ is  in the palne of $u$ and $v$
